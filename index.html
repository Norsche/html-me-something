                        "The campaign takes place in broad borderland region known as the Nentir Vale. The vale is now mostly empty, with a handful of living villages and towns scattered over this wide area. Abanonded farmsteads, ruined manors, and broken keeps litter the countryside. Bandits, wild animals, and monsters roam freely throughout the vale, threatening anyone who fares more than few miles away from one of the surviving settlements. Travel along the roads or river is usually safe--usually. But every now and then, travelers come to bad ends between towns."

He took this opportunity and made a businessman and warrior of himself, so that he could the Incorruptible on their adventures.
